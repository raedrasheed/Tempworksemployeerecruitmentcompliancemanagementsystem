## Findings

- **[INFO]** `model.job_ads.no-direct-ownership` — NO ownership column today (global slug)
- **[INFO]** `model.documents.no-direct-ownership` — entity-keyed; tenancy via parent
- **[INFO]** `model.attendance_records.no-direct-ownership` — via Employee
- **[INFO]** `model.attendance_locked_periods.no-direct-ownership` — GLOBAL today; must become per-tenant
- **[INFO]** `model.financial_records.no-direct-ownership` — entity-keyed
- **[INFO]** `model.workflows.no-direct-ownership` — no ownership; system-template + clone-on-use planned
- **[WARN]** `model.vehicles.null-owner` — 1 rows with NULL agencyId — must be reconciled before backfill.
- **[INFO]** `model.identifier_sequences.no-direct-ownership` — GLOBAL today; must become per-tenant
- **[INFO]** `model.workshops.no-direct-ownership` — GLOBAL today; review per-tenant ownership

## Notes
- Models with `entity-keyed` ownership (Document, FinancialRecord) need a tenantId denorm in Phase 2 derived from the parent entity at backfill time.
- Global models (workshops, identifier_sequences, attendance_locked_periods) require a per-tenant split decision before any backfill writes.
